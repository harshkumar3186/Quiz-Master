/*
( #include <bits/stdc++.h> ) -> This line includes the entire standard library in a single line.
The code starts with including the necessary libraries for input/output operations (iostream), generating random numbers (cstdlib), and seeding the random number generator (ctime).
Three function prototypes are declared: displayResult(), celebrate(), and commiserate(). These functions will be defined later in the code.
The main() function is defined as the entry point of the program.
Inside the main() function, a char variable playAgain is declared to store the user's choice of playing the quiz again.
The srand(time(0)) statement seeds the random number generator based on the current time, ensuring different random numbers on each program run.
The code enters a do-while loop, which allows the user to play the quiz multiple times until they choose not to.
Inside the loop, the score is initialized to 0, and the quiz instructions are displayed.
The user is prompted to enter 's' to start the quiz. If the input is not 's' or 'S', an error message is displayed, and the loop continues to the next iteration.
The questionNumber variable is initialized to 1.
A while loop is used to iterate through the 10 quiz questions. The questionNumber determines which question is displayed.
For each question, the options are displayed, and the user is prompted to enter their answer as a character.
Based on the user's answer, if it matches the correct option, the score is incremented by 1.
After each question, the questionNumber is incremented.
After all the questions have been answered, the quiz result is displayed, along with the total score.
Depending on the score, the celebrate() or commiserate() function is called to display a random celebratory or encouraging message.
The user is prompted whether they want to play the quiz again. If the input is 'y' or 'Y', the loop continues to the next iteration.
Outside the loop, a closing message is displayed, and the program terminates.
The celebrate() function generates a random number between 0 and 2 and uses a switch statement to display a random celebratory message.
The commiserate() function generates a random number between 0 and 2 and uses a switch statement to display a random message of encouragement.
