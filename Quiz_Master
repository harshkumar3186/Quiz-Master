/*
The code begins with the necessary include statements to use input/output operations and generate random numbers.
The function prototypes for playQuiz(), displayResult(), celebrate(), and commiserate() are declared.
The main() function is defined, which serves as the entry point of the program.
The variable playAgain is declared to store the user's choice of playing the quiz again.
srand(time(0)) is called to seed the random number generator using the current time. This ensures different random numbers are generated on each run.
The code enters a do-while loop, which allows the user to play the quiz multiple times.
Inside the loop, playQuiz() function is called and its return value is stored in finalResult.
The user's score is displayed using cout.
The displayResult() function is called, which prints the quiz result and a corresponding message based on the score.
Depending on the score, either celebrate() or commiserate() function is called to provide a personalized message.
The user is prompted to play the quiz again. If the user enters 'y' or 'Y', the loop continues. Otherwise, the loop ends.
After exiting the loop, a "Thank you" message is displayed, and the program terminates by returning 0.
The playQuiz() function is defined, responsible for conducting the quiz and returning the user's score.
Various instructions and quiz questions are displayed using cout.
The user is prompted to press 's' to start the quiz. If an invalid input is provided, the function is recursively called until a valid input is received.
Quiz questions are displayed one by one, and the user's answers are read using cin. If the answer is correct, the score is incremented.
Finally, the score is returned to the calling function.
The displayResult() function is defined, which takes the user's score as input and displays the quiz result along with a pass or fail message.
The celebrate() function is defined, which generates a random number and displays a random celebratory message using a switch statement.
The commiserate() function is defined, which generates a random number and displays a random message of encouragement using a switch statement.
